## READ THIS NO MATTER WHAT!!

I was noticing huge performance issues on the desktop. Especially on easy things like watching a yt vid.
I noticed in nvtop there were 2 gpus. One for Nvidia and for my Intel integrated. 
I thought that was weird, after all, I am plugged into the gpu.

WRONG.

My second monitor was plugged into the cpu because I ran out of HDMI ports. Unplugging that fixed all of my GPU issues. All of them. Including Gamescope.
