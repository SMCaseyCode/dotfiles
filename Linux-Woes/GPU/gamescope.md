This is cooked.

Using nvidia and gamescope is not a good recipe in 2025.
The official repo and the -bin repo in AUR both fail. Not because of config but because of drivers.
For now, just rawdog game or dual boot windows.

A good way to test if gamescope is working is by simply doing
`gamescope -- vkbox`
